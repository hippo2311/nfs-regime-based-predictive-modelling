## **Paper 1: [Regime‑Switching Factor Investing Using Hidden Markov Models](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/13/12/311) — Wang, Lin & Mikhelson (2020)**
Wang et al. (2020) propose a regime‑switching approach to factor investing, where a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) identifies latent market states that guide dynamic portfolio allocation. The authors aim to classify bull and bear market regimes using purely quantitative techniques and to rotate among different factor strategies accordingly. Using historical data from the U.S. equity market (2007–2017) and the S&P 500 as the underlying reference index, the model estimates the probability that the market is currently in each regime and adjusts factor exposure based on the most probable state.

Their results show that switching between factor models depending on the detected market regime significantly improves out‑of‑sample performance. In the 2017–2020 test period, the HMM‑based adaptive factor strategy achieved higher absolute and risk‑adjusted returns than any static factor model used in isolation. The main finding is that timely recognition of regime changes—such as transitions from expansion to recession or from calm to volatile markets—allows the investor to rebalance exposures toward factors historically favored in similar regimes. The study’s strength lies in its use of unsupervised machine learning for regime detection, which avoids subjective classification. Its limitation, however, is the relatively short time span and single‑market focus. Nonetheless, the study offers crucial empirical evidence that quantitative regime detection can meaningfully enhance factor return prediction, aligning strongly with our project’s methodological foundation.

## **Paper 2: [Factor Timing: Keep It Simple](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/876-factor-timing-keep-it-simple) — Aked (2021, Research Affiliates)**
Michael Aked’s (2021) Research Affiliates white paper takes a practitioner’s view on the challenge of timing equity factors and tests whether macroeconomic or cyclical signals can meaningfully improve performance. The study evaluates three systematic timing strategies across eight equity style factors (Market, Value, Size, Investment, Profitability, Low Volatility, Momentum, and Liquidity) over six global regions (U.S., Europe, U.K., Japan, Australia, and Emerging Markets) from 1969 onward. The three timing rules are:
1) Performance momentum—tilting toward recently outperforming factors;
2) Economic cycle prediction—allocating based on the predicted macroeconomic phase (expansion, slowdown, recession, recovery); and
3) Factor valuation plus momentum—increasing weights for factors that are both undervalued and currently gaining momentum.

The empirical results reveal that strategy (3)—combining factor valuation and factor momentum—delivers the highest Sharpe ratio and most consistent alpha generation. By contrast, pure factor momentum (strategy 1) performs no better than random, and macroeconomic cycle‑based timing (strategy 2) adds little predictive power. While Research Affiliates acknowledge that “upcoming economic phases influence factor performance,” they emphasize that accurately forecasting these phases is extremely difficult with current data. Therefore, direct market‑based signals (valuation and momentum) tend to capture much of the same information that macro predictors would provide. The key takeaway is pragmatic: economic awareness is valuable conceptually, but simplicity in signal design yields more robust out‑of‑sample performance. For our project, Aked’s findings serve as a caution that regime identification must be statistically strong and economically interpretable—otherwise, macro‑based factor timing may underperform simpler, data‑driven approaches.

## **Paper 3: [Regimes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5164863.pdf?abstractid=5164863&mirid=1) — Mulliner, Harvey, Xia, Fang & van Hemert (2025, Man Group & Duke)**
Mulliner et al. (2025), in collaboration between Man Group and Professor Campbell Harvey, introduce a non‑parametric regime identification framework that resonates strongly with our project design. Instead of assuming a fixed number or type of regimes (e.g., “expansion” or “recession”), their model constructs a macroeconomic feature vector for each month—consisting of GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility measures—and computes the similarity between current and historical macro conditions. The most similar historical periods form the “regime analogues,” while the least similar are designated as “anti‑regimes.”

The authors then evaluate how factor portfolios historically performed in those similar regimes, using six long–short equity factors from 1985–2024. Their results show that factor allocation guided by regime analogues consistently outperforms static weighting and yields statistically significant positive alpha even after transaction costs. Intriguingly, the study finds that “anti‑regimes” (historical conditions least similar to today) also contain predictive value, providing insights into which factors to avoid. The strength of this approach lies in its data‑driven flexibility—it discovers meaningful macro patterns without imposing arbitrary regime labels. However, its interpretability is lower than traditional models, as the regimes are discovered algorithmically rather than defined by explicit economic categories. Still, this study provides powerful evidence that macro‑regime similarity analysis—essentially what our project implements—can generate genuine predictive information about factor performance.

## **Paper 4: [Dynamic Asset Allocation with Asset‑Specific Regime Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09578.pdf) — Shu, Yu & Mulvey (2024)**
Yu, Mulvey, and Nie (2025) (related work; Shu, Yu & Mulvey, 2024) present a rigorous academic framework that integrates regime identification and machine learning‑based regime forecasting for dynamic factor allocation. Their central innovation is the notion of “allocation‑focused regimes”—regimes defined not by macro variables per se, but by relative patterns of factor performance. The study first applies a jump model to detect structural breaks in the relative returns of different factor strategies, effectively segmenting history into distinct performance regimes. Then, using XGBoost, the authors forecast the probability of entering each identified regime based on macroeconomic and market indicators such as yield curve slope, volatility indices, and growth metrics.

Empirical tests using U.S. equity factor portfolios (1960–2024) demonstrate that portfolios dynamically tilted according to these regime forecasts significantly outperform both static equal‑weighted allocations and naive momentum‑based timing. Applications include multi‑factor dynamic allocation and paired factor switching (e.g., Value vs. Growth, Momentum vs. Reversal). In both cases, regime‑aware models achieve higher Sharpe ratios and positive information ratios even after transaction costs. Strengths include the blend of modern ML (XGBoost) with interpretable economic modeling; limitations include computational complexity and potential overfitting.

## **Paper 5: [Time to Tilt: Harnessing Factor Cyclicality](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/factor-timing) — BlackRock Systematic (2025)**
The BlackRock Systematic Equities team (2025) presents a practitioner‑focused framework for dynamic factor rotation implemented in the actively managed ETF DYNF. Their philosophy is that factor performance is inherently cyclical—each factor thrives under specific macroeconomic and market conditions—and investors can enhance returns by “tilting” toward those currently favored. The framework integrates four signal dimensions: (1) macroeconomic regime, (2) factor valuation, (3) factor momentum (sentiment), and (4) factor‑specific fundamentals.

BlackRock combines these signals into a composite factor outlook to overweight “tailwind” factors and underweight “headwind” ones. Evidence from DYNF’s real‑world implementation (2021–2024) shows that this multi‑signal, regime‑aware approach generated positive alpha, improved multi‑year Sharpe ratios, and reduced drawdowns relative to static multifactor portfolios. While model details remain proprietary, the approach exemplifies a multi‑dimensional predictive framework that blends macro, behavioral, and structural insights—precisely the philosophy our project seeks to emulate.
